            <h2 style = "text-align: center">Evolution from 1G to 5G</h2>        
            <p style = "text-align: justify" >The mobile communication industry has developed steadily for more than 70 years since the launch of 1G. 1950 saw the introduction of 1G, an analogue system with call-making capabilities. The development of 2G technology in the 1980s allowed users to communicate via text with different devices. A faster and more efficient network option that offers streaming and video calling is 3G. The most current versions, 4G and 5G, offer cutting-edge technologies like the internet of things and have lower latency. Despite the fact that 5G is still under development and has a wide variety of applications, it also has major drawbacks.
                The mobile radiotelephone first became accessible in the 1950s. In the 1980s, the first 1G cellular mobile radio networks debuted. In these analogue cellular networks intended to offer voice communications, each call utilised a distinct narrowband frequency channel. The Total Access Communications System (TACS), Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT), among other cellular standards, have all been used in different geographical areas. Although these standards did not specify a positioning mechanism, vehicle location was previously intended to enhance cellular calls' communication performance through system control. For example, choosing a cell site or speaking channel can benefit from knowing the vehicle's position, which was normally estimated using location algorithms based on signal strength.
                The 2G system, which stands for second generation, was primarily created for speech transmission using digital signals at up to 64kbps rates. The late 1980s saw its initial deployment, and the late 1990s saw its completion. In contrast to 1G, which prioritised oral communication, 2G wireless cellular mobile services include short messaging service (SMS). The bandwidth of 2G is 30–200 KHz. During the second generation, the mobile telecommunications market grew quickly in terms of subscribers and value-added services. The first GSM-based 2G phones appeared in the early 1990s. The 2G carriers additionally began to offer other services including voicemail, faxes, text messages, and pagers.
                
                3G uses extensive trademark wireless networks with increased transmission system support capabilities to achieve a data transmission rate of at least 2 Mbps. It has high-speed data transfer and is dependable, and it was originally released in 2000. By describing a flexible architecture that meets with an IMT 2000 standard, the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), an organisation established to assist in the creation of the 3G network, has advanced the effort. When compared to 2G, 3G's expanded information transfer capabilities are many times faster. The functionality has been expanded to include terminated IP files, audio, video, and bandwidth requirements for web applications (for example Skype). Between 100 and 300 Mbps are the peak data rates.
                
                4G wireless technology is frequently referred to by the abbreviation "MAGIC," which stands for Mobile multimedia, Anywhere, Global mobility solutions over, integrated wireless, and Customized services. The basic idea of 4G is convergence, which includes the fusion of wired and wireless networks, Bluetooth, wireless LAN, and GSM as well as computers, consumer electronics, communication technology, and many other fields. 4G is mobile multimedia that is accessible everywhere, anytime thanks to global mobility support, an integrated wireless solution, and a personalised personal service network system. 4G is an all-IP-based integrated system with end-to-end QoS and strong security that can deliver 100 Mbps for high mobility and 1 Gbps for low mobility.
                With just one millisecond of lag, 5G can  significantly improve communication. It will have 1,000 bits of bandwidth per square foot. An Internet of Things device is predicted to have a 10-year battery life. Depending on the device, a high speed of up to 10 GB per second will be offered. There should be a 90% reduction in network energy consumption. 99% uptime for a network. Additionally, There are some unimaginable uses for 5G, like the ability to charge phones with your
                own heartbeat. With the help of our mobile, we can monitor our grandmother blood sugar levels. We can pinpoint the timing of births within nanoseconds. Before a tsunami or earthquake happens, we can sense it. We can use our mobile devices to access our office desktop, laptop, vehicle, and bicycle. Our stolen phone can be found in a matter of
                nanoseconds.</p>
